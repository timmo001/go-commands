# Go Commands Project Overview

This project is a Go-based service that integrates with Home Assistant through MQTT to provide system power control commands. The service allows remote control of system operations like shutdown, restart, sleep, and more.

## Key Components

- [main.go](mdc:main.go): The entry point that sets up MQTT connection and Home Assistant integration
- [handler/power.go](mdc:handler/power.go): Implements system power commands (shutdown, restart, sleep, etc.)
- [mqtt/client.go](mdc:mqtt/client.go): MQTT client implementation for Home Assistant communication

## Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration, stored in:
- [.env](mdc:.env): Main configuration file
- [.env.example](mdc:.env.example): Example configuration template

## Linux Service Setup

The project can be installed as a system service using:
- [go-commands.service](mdc:go-commands.service): Systemd service definition
- [setup-service.sh](mdc:setup-service.sh): Service installation script

## Windows setup

- The app can be setup and ran with [start.ps1](mdc:start.ps1)
- The app can be added to startup with [setup-startup.ps1](mdc:setup-startup.ps1)
