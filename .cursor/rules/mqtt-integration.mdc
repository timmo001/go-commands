# MQTT Integration Guide

The project uses MQTT for communication with Home Assistant, implementing automatic device discovery and command handling.

## MQTT Client

The MQTT client implementation in [mqtt/client.go](mdc:mqtt/client.go) provides:

- Automatic reconnection handling
- Quality of Service (QoS) support
- Home Assistant MQTT discovery message publishing
- Topic subscription with callbacks

## Home Assistant Integration

The service registers itself as a device in Home Assistant with:

- Status sensor showing online/offline state
- Power command buttons for each available system command
- Automatic device configuration through MQTT discovery

## Command Topics

Power commands are published to topics in the format:
`go-commands/{unique_id}/power/{command_name}`

Status updates are published to:
`go-commands/{unique_id}/status`
